## ManualSegmenter
Reading the "Best before date" on a food package, using API integrated
HALCON ManualSegmenter.

### Description
HALCON ManualSegmenter provides a precise way to read text with known
characteristics. All known text characteristics can be entered as parameters.

### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the webpage.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API, HALCON support and
AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware.
Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used in conjunction
with a HALCON developer license and dongle.
